# Image_background_subtraction
This repository includes methodologies for subtracting the background in fluorescence microscopy images.

 Uneven_background_correction:
    This script includes the functions required for a cell-free background estimation and subtraction. This is a fast implementation where a the cell-free background is calculated within square image sectors (tiles). These squared regions have a side which is a perfect divisor of the image dimensions. An alternative implementation, which is however slower, would involve a rolling window with a step of 1-pixel. An example for implementing background correction is provided in the test_uneven_background_correction.ipynb notebook.
